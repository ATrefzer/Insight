---------------------------------------
In Progress
---------------------------------------

- fast.ai has more entries than the tool suggests!
- Draw some UML images
- Layouting for circle packaging (run against old verison)
- Tests for TreeMap and CirclePackaging. (Large examples, see if they changed)

---------------------------------------
In TODO
---------------------------------------

- Investigate broken svn history. See CalculateChangeCouplings
- Classifier for names!
- Try on different git projects


Factories:
- HierarchicalData
- ColorScheme
- MetricProvider?


- Settings: Filters are applied to the summary. But Sync contribution already used the fiters. New sync should be done
  after the filters are changed. More restrictive is ok!
- Settings: When to clear the color scheme?

- Commits pro line statt absolute 

- Overlay texts


- TreeMap: TryAddToStrip, Move vertical / horizontal strip to new classes
- TreeMap: Refactoring stripProportion
- TreeMap: Show label (maybe)

- Chord: Sometimes edges disappear when resizing
- Chord: Binding errors

- Svn: Refactor parser
