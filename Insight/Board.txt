In TODO
---------------------------------------

- Investigate broken svn history. See CalculateChangeCouplings
- Classifier for names!
- Try on different git projects
- Settings: Filters are applied to the summary. But Sync contribution already used the fiters. New sync should be done
  after the filters are changed. More restrictive is ok!
- Settings: Ask user to clear Colors.txt when he changes the base directory in the settings window.


Factories:
- HierarchicalData
- ColorScheme
- MetricProvider?
