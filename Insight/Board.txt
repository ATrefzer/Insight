In TODO

 - Bugs in ntg

 - CleanupHistory cleanup. Expect cleaned history to be stored. No deletes!

 - Measure hashset vs dictionary intersect
- Investigate broken svn history. See CalculateChangeCouplings
- Settings allows to change read only project settings.
- Anonymize developer
- Color editor
- Classifier for names!
- Settings: Filters are applied to the summary. But Sync contribution already used the fiters. New sync should be done
  after the filters are changed. More restrictive is ok!
- In general: Where should files be filtered? Provider or outside? => Provider returns all tracked history No deletes within.



- Commits pro line statt absolute 

- Overlay texts

- Tests for TreeMap and CirclePackaging. (Large examples, see if they changed)

- TreeMap: TryAddToStrip, Move vertical / horizontal strip to new classes
- TreeMap: Refactoring stripProportion
- TreeMap: Show label (maybe)

- Chord: Sometimes edges disappear when resizing
- Chord: Binding errors

- Svn: Refactor parser
